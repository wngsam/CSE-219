Project Assignment from CSE 219 - Computer Science III from Spring 2013

RambleOnGame (requires MiniGameFramework and XMLUtilities) is a game played on maps from all over the world. There are various modes but in all of them the idea is to find the correct items, whether that is an area, a flag or a leader.

TheRegionPickerGame is a simplified version where the map is only of Bhutan.

Note: MiniGameFramework and XMLUtilities were provided by Professor McKenna.
